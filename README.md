# Meca500 Flyscan IOC

This repository contains a prototype pythonSoftIOC. This IOC enables position control of Meca500 joints via a file of new line seperated joint sets.
Joint values must be comma seperated, and the file must be placed in the Trajectories directory.
The IOC can be run by executing:

```bash
> ./boot.sh
```
